# Restaurant Review App

## Project Description

In this project, I have converted a static webpage to a mobile-friendly, accessible, and offline-first web application.
The completed application follows a grid-layout to provide responsiveness on different device sizes.
The application includes standard accessibility features such as proper tabb-order, descriptive alt texts for images, and
frustration-free experience on the map application. The application also implements a service worker to
cache the contents and display them even if the user is not connected to the internet.

## Requirements

To run the application you'll need to clone the repository and have a web server running. The easiest way is to install
python (preferably python 3) and navigate to the project directory and run:

    python -m http.server 8000

If you have python 2 installed you can run:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Then head over to your browser and visit http://localhost:8000
