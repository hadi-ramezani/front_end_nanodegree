# Classic Arcade Game

## Project Description

In this project, I have implemented the classic Arcade game that runs in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game consists of a player and multiple bugs. The goal of the player is to reach the water (the blue region on the
top) without colliding with the bugs. Every time the player reaches the water, it obtains some points and proceeds to
a new stage. In each stage, the bugs move faster. The number of points that the player gains at each stage is equivalent
to the stage number. For example, if the player reaches the water at stage 8, it obtains 8 points. If a collision happens
between the bugs and the player, the player loses one life and it's position gets reset. The game ends once the player
loses all of its lives. Technically, there's no end to the game but at some point the bugs will move so fast that it might
be impossible to cross :)

## Requirements

You should be able to play the game in any modern browser. Just double click on index.html to open it in your browser.
