# Memory Game

## Project Description

In this project, I've built a card-matching game that runs in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user is
presented by a 4 by 4 grid consisting of 8 pairs of cards. Each card has a symbol on it. At the beginning, the cards are places faced down.
When the user clicks on a card, it gets flipped over. The user has a chance to pick a matching card. If the second card
matches the first one, both cards will stay faced up. This continues until all cards are being matched. Every click on a
pair of card counts as a move. The user initially has three stars. They lose one star per very 10 moves. A timer also shows
the elapsed time on the screen. Once the game is completed, the user is presented with a pop-up message showing the summary
of the game and a chance to restart the game.

## Requirements

You should be able to play the game in any modern browser. Just double click on index.html to open it in your browser.
